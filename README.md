## About The Project

[Tokesim](https://github.com/tokesim/tokesim) is an Agent Based Modeling tool that makes it easy to test token economic models. It's built using [mesa-behaviors](https://github.com/tokesim/mesa_behaviors) an extension to [Mesa](https://github.com/mesaproject/mesa) that makes models,agents,utility functions and strategies shareable and more extensible.  The goal of Tokesim is to help developers run simulations against smart contracts, in a blockchain agnostic way, using shareable and reusable modules and libraries to do so. 

Tokesim Features:
- Type hints to make agents and models extensible 
- Ability to run against and simulation against your smart contracts
- An architecture to make the simulations portable to multiple chains
- ChartJS integration from Mesa framework
- Support for testing Ethereum based smart contracts directly


<!-- getting started with the project -->
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- node `v10.15.3` or later
- npm `v6.4.1` or later
- python `3.7` or later but not 3.8 ;) 

### Installation
Clone/ download the project, and install dependencies. For development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tokesim/tokesim.git && cd tokesim 
python3.7 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install poetry
poetry build
npm install -g @tokesim/tokesim-chain
# in a new terminal window
tokesim-chain --port 5554
```
or 
```bash
pip install tokesim
npm install -g @tokesim/tokesim-chain
# in a new terminal window
tokesim-chain --port 3004
```


<!-- example usage, screen shots, demos -->
## Usage
### Run simulation 
In order to run a simulation against a chain the default init will create a simulation for you to modify as you see fit. You'll need to start the chain simulation service.
```bash
# remember to activate your venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install tokesim

# just like create react app generate template
tokesim init --dir simple-token --agents 20

#start chain simulator
tokesim-chain -c ethereum --port 3004

#run the simulation defaults to terminating after 100 steps
tokesim run --config ./simple-token/simulation.json --port 3004
```

#### Simulation App Layout 

By default tokesim init will generate a default application layout, that specifies the accounts used a balance for each of the agents as well as configuration file and some simple bonded token curve agents. The contracts specified are a listed [here](https://github.com/tokesim/example-smart-contracts)

```bash
# ./simple-token/
.
└── simple-token    
    └── contracts 
    |    |── SimpleToken.bin
    |    └── SimpleToken_abi.json
    |── accounts.json    
    |── config_schema.json       
    |── simple_token_agent.py
    |── simple_token_model.py
    |── simple_token_config.py
    └── simulation.json
```
